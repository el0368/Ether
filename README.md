# Aether IDE ⚡

**The AI-Native, Cross-Platform IDE built on the BEAM.**

Aether is an experimental IDE designed for professional efficiency, leveraging the stability of Elixir and the reactivity of Svelte 5. It runs as a standalone desktop application but is built with web technologies, offering the best of both worlds.

## 🏗️ Stack (SPEL-AI)

*   **S**velte 5 (Frontend with Runes)
*   **P**hoenix (Backend & Real-time WebSocket)
*   **E**lixir (Core Business Logic & Agents)
*   **L**ucide/Tailwind (Styling & Icons)
*   **AI** (Integrated Agentic Workflows)
*   **Desktop**: Elixir Desktop (wxWidgets + WebView)

## 🚀 Features (Phase 2)

-   **Native Desktop Shell**: Runs as a standard Windows app using wxWidgets.
-   **Embedded WebView**: Full compatibility with modern web standards (Edge/WebKit).
-   **Agentic Core**:
    -   `FileServerAgent`: Safe filesystem access.
    -   `TestingAgent`: Automated test runner (`mix test`).
    -   `LintAgent`: Code quality checker (`mix credo`).
    -   `FormatAgent`: Auto-formatter (`mix format`).
-   **Svelte 5 UI**: Modern, reactive frontend using the latest Svelte Runes syntax.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
*   Elixir 1.15+ & Erlang/OTP 26+
*   Node.js 20+
*   Git

### Installation
1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    mix setup
    ```

### Running the Desktop App (Recommended)
We provide a helper script to launch the full environment:
```powershell
.\start_desktop.bat
```
This will compile assets, start the server, and open the Aether IDE window.

### Web-Only Development
If you prefer developing in the browser:
```bash
./start_dev.bat
```
Then visit: `http://localhost:4000`

## 🧠 Architecture

Aether allows "One Runtime" simplicity. The Elixir BEAM VM handles everything:
-   HTTP Server (Bandit)
-   WebSocket Channels (Phoenix)
-   Background Agents (GenServer)
-   GUI (wxWidgets)

No Rust/Zig NIFs are required for the core logic, ensuring strict stability and introspection capabilities.
