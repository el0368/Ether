# Ether V2: The Resilient IDE

Ether V2 is a high-performance, industrial-grade IDE built with Phoenix 1.7+, Svelte 5, and Pure Zig. 

## Architecture
- **Client-Dominant UI**: Svelte 5 manages interaction state to eliminate latency.
- **Pure Zig NIF**: Manual bridge for zero-interference file system scanning.
- **Asynchronous Persistence**: All I/O is non-blocking to prevent UI friction.

## Legacy Archive
All V1 documentation and architectural history can be found in `docs/v1/`.
