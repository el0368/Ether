# 🌌 Ether IDE: Grand Master Plan

## 🎯 The North Star: The Dual-Purpose Engine
Ether is a high-performance, AI-native development environment designed for two simultaneous missions:

1.  **The Self-Hosting IDE:** A pro-grade replacement for Antigravity/VS Code. Ether must be powerful enough, stable enough, and "smart" enough to build its own codebase.
2.  **The Academy Back-Stage:** A specialized Content Studio for authoring world-class mathematics curriculum.

## 📍 Strategic Roadmap (2026)

### Milestone 1: "The Core" (FINISHED)
- [x] **Unbreakable Native Layer:** Stack-safe Win32 bypass for Windows stability.
- [x] **Hardened Launcher:** Robust sub-second cleanup of ports and processes.
- [x] **Performance Observatory 2.0:** Multi-tier (Native/BEAM/IPC/Frontend) monitoring studio (sub-16ms verified).

### Milestone 2: "The Editor" (FINISHED)
- [x] **Aesthetic Refinement:** Implementation of the VS Code variable system (100% Visual Fidelity).
- [x] **Industrial UI Polish:** Functional dropdown menus, file operations, and terminal orchestration.
- [x] **Monaco Integration:** Pro-grade editor buffer with shared state.
- [x] **Standalone Capability:** IDE functions without backend for core file I/O.

### Milestone 3: "The Academy & Intelligence" (CURRENT)
- [ ] **Math-Native Authoring:** KaTeX integration for real-time LaTeX rendering.
- [ ] **Curriculum Sidebar:** Content-aware navigation (Grade > Subject > Topic).
- [ ] **Jido Agent Core:** Advanced orchestration for AI commanders.
- [ ] **Semantic Context:** Vector indexing for 100k+ file reasoning (PostgreSQL optional).
- [ ] **Internal Architect:** Gemini-powered self-repair and maintenance loop.

### Milestone 4: "The Cloud & Hybrid"
- [ ] **Cloud Shell:** Full feature parity between Tauri and Web Browser.
- [ ] **Remote Workspaces:** SSH and remote volume mounting for massive repos.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### 1. Native Engine (Zig/Rust - "The Muscle")
- **Hybrid I/O:** Rust/Tauri handles core file operations (Read/Write/Browse) for offline stability.
- **Level 5 Native Zig:** Direct Win32 interaction for high-speed file scanning and IPC.
- **Cooperative Scheduling:** Politeness at the BEAM level (yielding every 100 items).
- **AetherProtocol:** Symmetrical binary serialization for zero-copy UI updates.
- **Red-Line:** Scanner throughput must maintain **>125,000 files/sec**.

### 2. System Core (Elixir - "The Brain")
- **Agent Orchestration:** GenServer-based agents for logic-heavy tasks (Git, LSP, Intelligence).
- **Offline Resilience:** System remains functional for editing even if the BEAM shuts down.
- **Intelligence Strategy:** PostgreSQL used for vector search and long-term memory, not required for boot.
- **Self-Healing:** Continuous background quality checks and AI-driven crash recovery.

### 3. Frontend & UX (Svelte 5 - "The Face")
- **Runes Power:** Fine-grained reactivity for zero-lag UI.
- **Direct Pipeline:** Slabs of binary data transformed directly into Svelte stores.
- **VS Code Aesthetic:** Pure CSS variable-driven theme with Lucide Icons.
- **Red-Line:** Sub-10ms UI update for all local user interactions.

## 🏎️ Performance & Quality Matrix

| Metric | Target | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **E2E Latency** | **< 16ms** | Necessary for the "Snap" feel (60fps). |
| **LSP Throughput** | **10k lines/s** | Instant semantics on large files. |
| **IPC Overhead** | **Sub-µs** | Prevents UI stutter in massive monorepos. |
| **Stability** | **0 Crashes** | No exceptions, no access violations. |

## 🤖 The Self-Evolving IDE Concept
Ether is designed to eventually **outgrow external aids**.
- **The Internal Architect:** An embedded Gemini agent that manages the codebase.
- **Autonomous Recovery:** Automatically fixes its own build errors and handles dependency upgrades (e.g., Zig 0.15+ transition).
